# Project Overview: E-commerce Data Analysis

## 1. Web Data Parsing with BeautifulSoup (deliveroo_parsing.py)

### Description:
The `deliveroo_parsing.py` script utilizes BeautifulSoup to parse HTML files containing order information from the Deliveroo platform. It extracts crucial details such as order number, customer information, restaurant details, item specifics, and total costs. The parsed data is then structured and stored in a JSON file for further analysis.

### Sample Output:
- The output file, `orders_data_parsed.json`, provides a structured view of orders, including customer details, restaurant information, item specifics, and total costs.

## 2. Customer Subscription Analysis (SQL Script)

### Description:
The SQL script analyzes a dataset related to customer orders on a Deliveroo-like platform. It identifies subscription cycles by tracking instances where customers consecutively subscribe for 3 or more deliveries. The analysis includes the start and end dates of each subscription cycle, providing insights into customer behavior and subscription patterns.

### Sample Output:
- The output includes a detailed breakdown of identified subscription cycles, showcasing start and end dates, allowing for a deeper understanding of customer interactions with the subscription model.

## 3. E-commerce Data Analysis (Tableau Story)

### Description:
The Tableau story explores various parameters within an e-commerce dataset. It performs basic analyses by comparing parameters such as customer demographics, order details, and total costs. The visualizations aim to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can inform strategic decisions for the e-commerce platform.

### Sample Output:
- The Tableau story file presents visualizations that highlight relationships between different parameters, providing a comprehensive view of key metrics and trends in the e-commerce data.
