## Customer Subscription Analysis, E-commerce

In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of customer subscription patterns on an e-commerce platform using Google BigQuery and advanced SQL techniques. The goal was to identify instances where customers consecutively subscribed for 3 or more deliveries, shedding light on key insights into their subscription behaviors.

### Approach and Methodology:

- Leveraged Google BigQuery's capabilities to efficiently handle and process large-scale e-commerce datasets.
  
- Developed a comprehensive SQL script incorporating window functions to calculate running totals and identify subscription cycles based on specific criteria.

- Utilized a nuanced approach to pinpoint the exact start and end dates of each identified subscription cycle, ensuring precision in the analysis.

### Key Contributions:

- Enhanced the platform's understanding of customer engagement by providing actionable insights into subscription behaviors.

- Empowered decision-making processes by offering clear visibility into subscription cycle dynamics and customer preferences.

### Results:

The output of the analysis includes a detailed breakdown of identified subscription cycles, showcasing start and end dates, allowing for a deeper understanding of customer interactions with the subscription model.

### Impact:

This project played a crucial role in informing targeted improvements to the subscription model, contributing to a more tailored and customer-centric approach. The insights derived from this analysis provided a foundation for data-driven decision-making, ultimately optimizing the overall customer experience on the e-commerce platform.
